  "statement": "The making of <em>Wandering Star</em> begins with instinctual video documentation taken while walking through the aftermath of a snowstorm. The original footage is cut, manipulated, and distorted. Using color, texture, and space through addition and subtraction, <em>Wandering Star</em> is meant to be at once familiar and unfamiliar."
